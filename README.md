IcoStash Pattern Library.

IcoStash is a stock iconography website made by graphic designers for graphic designers.
With the target audience in mind, the visual style of this website was tailored to their needs.

Focusing on a minimalistic visual design, the product (icons) are the focus of attention.
To show strength in the icons, all icons are displayed as cutouts of the cards they lay on top of.

In having the products (icons) site on top of the only colour on the site, the viewers eyes are immediately drawn to the icons.
